# Handout for workshops on Test-driven Development with TYPO3 CMS

In this repository, you can find the English and German handout for my
workshops on test-driven development (TDD) and unit testing for TYPO3 CMS
using PHPUnit.

The directory [AdditionalDocuments/](AdditionalDocuments/) contains additional
single documents:

* the [PHPUnit mocking cheatsheet](AdditionalDocuments/mocking-cheatsheet.pdf)

The directory [Resources/](Resources/) contains additional resources:

* the [Live Templates for tests in PhpStorm](Resources/PhpStorm/LiveTemplates.zip)

## Example projects

* [Tea example](https://github.com/oliverklee/tea-for-workshops)
  for testing Extbase TYPO3 extensions
* [Anagram finder](https://github.com/oliverklee/anagram-finder)
  is the finished result of a code kata for TDD
* [Coffee example](https://github.com/oliverklee/coffee)
  is my starting point for demonstrating TDD
